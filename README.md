# GShade-UIShadow
An accessibility shader for FFXIV using GShade.

Just drop `UIShadow.fx` into GShade's Shader folder, reachable by either navigating to your FFXIV install dir: `.\game\gshade-shaders\Shaders` or usually in `C:\Program Files\GShade\gshade-shaders\Shaders`.

The look of the Shadow can be controlled with two sliders. I have not yet tested it alongside other Shaders, but it should likely be placed at the very bottom of your pipeline.
